Knowledge required: SASL-Authentication and Authentication-Dovecot

the relationship between **OAuth2** and **Dovecot's user/password databases** is quite different from traditional auth.

---

### 🔐 Traditional Authentication in Dovecot

- Dovecot checks the user's **password** using the `passdb`.
- Then fetches mail-related info from the `userdb`.

---

### 🧭 With OAuth2 (XOAUTH2)

OAuth2 **replaces** the need for a traditional password. Instead of a password, the client sends an **access token** (usually from Google, Microsoft, or your own IdP).

So, the **flow changes**:

| Step | Traditional Auth | OAuth2 Auth (XOAUTH2) |
|------|------------------|------------------------|
| 1    | Username + Password → `passdb` verifies it | Username + OAuth2 token → Dovecot verifies token |
| 2    | If password ok → `userdb` provides home, UID, etc | If token valid → `userdb` still used for mail info |

### 🔄 Role of `passdb` and `userdb` with OAuth2

#### ✅ `passdb`
- Still used!
- But instead of checking a password, it delegates token validation.
- You set `auth_mechanisms = xoauth2`.
- You configure a `passdb` using a plugin or external script that can **validate the OAuth2 token** (usually against a public key or introspection endpoint).
- You can use `checkpassword` or `oauth2` plugin (Dovecot v2.3+).

#### ✅ `userdb`
- Still required.
- After the token is validated, Dovecot uses `userdb` to get the user's home/mail info, UID/GID, etc.

### 🔧 Example Dovecot Config for OAuth2 (simplified)

```conf
auth_mechanisms = xoauth2

passdb {
  driver = oauth2
  args = /etc/dovecot/oauth2.conf.ext
}

userdb {
  driver = static
  args = uid=vmail gid=vmail home=/var/mail/vhosts/%d/%n
}
```

In `/etc/dovecot/oauth2.conf.ext`, you'd define how Dovecot verifies tokens, e.g., via introspection URL or JWT public keys.

---

### 🔁 Summary

- OAuth2 tokens **replace passwords**.
- `passdb` is still used — but for **token validation**, not password checks.
- `userdb` is still needed — Dovecot needs it to know where the user’s mail is stored.
- OAuth2 and traditional password auth can co-exist if needed.

If you're setting up OAuth2 for Dovecot now, let me know which IdP (Google, Microsoft, custom) and I can give you an exact config or script for validation.
